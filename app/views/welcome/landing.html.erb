<h3>SpendingAlert App Tips</h3>
Make sure all your large and reoccurring expenses are paid before the 15th of the month at the latest.  Because if recurring bills are not paid then the spending alert is not accurate and that defeats the whole point of the SpendingAlert App.
Try to limit the number of credit cards you use each month. This will help with managing your money and the connections to the SpendingAlert App easier.
Make sure you set a realistic spending limit to start. For example, if you make $5,000 per month after taxes you might set a spending limit at $4,500. Inorder to have a $500 per month savings goal. In the future you can reduce your spending limit even more.
